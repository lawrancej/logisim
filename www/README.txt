The Web site as it appears in translated versions is different in several small
ways from the original English version. The English version meant for
translation is found in the 'en' subdirectory. (The original English version is
in the 'root' subdirectory.)

Each translation directory has a file named 'template.html', which is the
template used for generating the various HTML files in that translation. The
other HTML files contain just the main body.

Please be sure to save each file using the UTF-8 encoding.
