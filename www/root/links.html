<h2>Libraries</h2>

<p>This section contains libraries of components that can be
imported into Logisim. If you have your own library of
components that you think would be useful to others, I'll be
happy to post a link here to a hosting Web site or to the
library itself.</p>

library</a> (<a href=download/7400-series-rev1.zip>ZIP</a>,

<dd>A set of Logisim circuits corresponding to a large number of
7400-series chips, produced by Technological Services Company.

<h2>Free graphical tools</h2>

<p>My hope is that some day some other software developers out there
will create something that in my view renders Logisim irrelevant.
So I occasionally browse the <q>competition</q> to see whether that day
has come.  Here's a list of links, and you can judge for yourself.</p>

<ul>

<li><a
href="http://www.spsu.edu/cs/faculty/bbrown/circuits/howto.html">Digital
Works 2.0</a> is Windows freeware. It is a fairly complete
package, but it is no longer under development. I no longer know
where one can download a copy. <em>18 Jul 2007</em>.</li>

<li><a href="http://tams-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/applets/hades/webdemos/index.html">HADES</a>
is a Java-based tool, which is available at no cost but does not
appear to be open-source. The simulation and library functionality
is quite extensive, but the interface is on the awkward side.
<em>18 Jul 2007</em></li>

<li><a href="http://www.cs.mtu.edu/~pop/jlsp/bin/JLS.html">JLS</a>
is a Java-based tool that is available at no cost from the author but
is not open-source or freeware. It doesn't simulate circuits as you
build them, but its simulation capabilities are more extensive than
Logisim's. <em>18 Jul 2007</em></li>

<li><a href="index.html">Logisim</a> is an open source Java tool.
Of course, I think it's the best choice. <em>18 Jul 2007</em></li>

<li><a href="http://www.softronix.com/logic.html">MultiMedia
Logic</a> is open source Windows software; It doesn't seem to support
hierarchical circuits or wire bundling, so it's quite limited as far
as designing CPU-scale circuits, but it does provide a fun set of
I/O components. <em>18 Jul 2007</em></li>

<li><a href="http://www.tkgate.org/index.html">TkGate</a> is
open source software. It's probably the most legitimate no-cost
competitor to Logisim: It's simulation facilities seem quite sound,
though the interface strikes me as rather awkward. It requires tcl/tk
to run; it can run on Windows if you have Cygwin installed.
<em>18 Jul 2007</em></li>

<li><a href="http://math.hws.edu/TMCM/java/xLogicCircuits/">xLogicCircuits</a>
is my favorite among the bare-bones Java applets. It has some
utility if you're spending one or two weeks introducing students to
the subject.  <em>18 Jul 2007</em></li>

<li>Other alternatives I have investigated, but which don't yet seem
have much to recommend them:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.a-rostin.de/klogic/">KLogic</a>, open
source Linux</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tetzl.de/java_logic_simulator.html">LogicSim</a>, open source Java</li>
<li><a href="http://web.mit.edu/ara/www/ds.html">Digital Simulator</a>, closed source shareware, free for education</li>
</ul></li>

</ul>

<p>You might also find my more exhaustive <a
href="links-2002.html">outdated list</a> useful. Maybe.</p>

<h2>Commercial graphical tools</h2>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.matrixmultimedia.com">Digital Works
3.0</a> is a commercial Windows product; I have not tried it, but
presumably it is more thorough than Digital Works 2.0, which was
already good. It does not seem to be under active development.
<em>18 Jul 2007</em></li>

<li><a href="http://www.logicworks5.com">LogicWorks</a> is a
Windows-specific commercial product also, but it seems more likely to
receive continuing support. I have not tried it, but it seems like
a thorough system.  It includes some support for incorporating VHDL
specifications. <em>18 Jul 2007</em></li>

<li>Others:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.research-systems.com/easysim/easysim.htm">EasySim</a>, commercial Windows</li>
<li><a href="http://home.arcor.de/khloch/locad/index.htm">LOCAD</a>, commercial(?) Windows, in German</li>
</ul></li>

</ul>

<h2>Text-based tools</h2>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.icarus.com/eda/verilog/">Icarus
Verilog</a>, the dominant open-source Verilog compiler</li>

<li>Others:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/~elm/Software/Esim/">esim</a>, source available but license unclear, uses custom language</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/logicsim/">Iowa Logic Specification Language</a>, open source, uses custom language</li>
<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/veriwell/">VeriWell</a>, open source, uses Verilog</li>
</ul></li>

</ul>
